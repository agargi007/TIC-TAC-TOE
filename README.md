TIC TAC TOE


A vibrant, responsive web implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, featuring both 2-player and player vs computer (AI) modes. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a modern gradient design and a persistent watermark for branding.

ðŸŽ® Project Overview
Tic Tac Toe is a timeless two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking empty spaces with their symbol (X or O). The first to align three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins. If all spaces are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

A visually appealing, gradient-themed interface

A landing page to select between two gameplay modes

Smooth, interactive gameplay for both modes

A persistent, dark-grey watermark for subtle branding
